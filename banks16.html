	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<div id="abstract">
		<p>We give upper and lower bounds on the information-theoretic threshold for community detection in the stochastic block model. Specifically, consider a symmetric stochastic block model with <span class="math">\(q\)</span> groups, average degree <span class="math">\(d\)</span>, and connection probabilities <span class="math">\(c_{\mathrm{in}}/n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(c_{\mathrm{out}}/n\)</span> for within-group and between-group edges respectively; let <span class="math">\(\lambda = (c_{\mathrm{in}}-c_{\mathrm{out}})/(qd)\)</span>. We show that, when <span class="math">\(q\)</span> is large, and <span class="math">\(\lambda = O(1/q)\)</span>, the critical value of <span class="math">\(d\)</span> at which community detection becomes possible—in physical terms, the condensation threshold—is <span class="math">\[d_{\mathrm{c}} = \Theta\left( \frac{\log q}{q \lambda^2} \right) \, ,\]</span> with tighter results in certain regimes. Above this threshold, we show that any partition of the nodes into <span class="math">\(q\)</span> groups which is as ‘good’ as the planted one, in terms of the number of within- and between-group edges, is correlated with it. This gives an exponential-time algorithm that performs better than chance; specifically, community detection becomes possible below the Kesten-Stigum bound for <span class="math">\(q \ge 5\)</span> in the disassortative case <span class="math">\(\lambda &lt; 0\)</span>, and for <span class="math">\(q \ge 11\)</span> in the assortative case <span class="math">\(\lambda &gt; 0\)</span> (similar upper bounds were obtained independently by Abbe and Sandon). Conversely, below this threshold, we show that no algorithm can label the vertices better than chance, or even distinguish the block model from an Erds-Rényi random graph with high probability.</p>
<p>Our lower bound on <span class="math">\(d_{\mathrm{c}}\)</span> uses Robinson and Wormald’s small subgraph conditioning method, and we also give (less explicit) results for non-symmetric stochastic block models. In the symmetric case, we obtain explicit results by using bounds on certain functions of doubly stochastic matrices due to Achlioptas and Naor; indeed, our lower bound on <span class="math">\(d_{\mathrm{c}}\)</span> is their second moment lower bound on the <span class="math">\(q\)</span>-colorability threshold for random graphs with a certain effective degree.</p>
