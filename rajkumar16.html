	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<div id="abstract">
		Ranking from pairwise comparisons is a ubiquitous problem and has been studied in disciplines ranging from statistics to operations research and from theoretical computer science to machine learning. Here we consider a general setting where outcomes of pairwise comparisons between items <span class="math">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(j\)</span> are drawn probabilistically by flipping a coin with unknown bias <span class="math">\(P_{ij}\)</span> , and ask under what conditions on these unknown probabilities one can learn a good ranking from comparisons of only <span class="math">\(O(n\log(n))\)</span> non-actively chosen pairs. Recent work has established this is possible under the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) and noisy permutation (NP) models. Here we introduce a broad family of ‘low-rank’ conditions on the probabilities <span class="math">\(P_{ij}\)</span> under which the resulting preference matrix <span class="math">\(P\)</span> has low rank under some link function, and show these conditions encompass the BTL and Thurstone classes as special cases, but are considerably more general. We then give a new algorithm called low-rank pairwise ranking (LRPR) which provably learns a good ranking from comparisons of only <span class="math">\(O(n\log(n))\)</span> randomly chosen comparisons under such low-rank models. Our algorithm and analysis make use of tools from the theory of low-rank matrix completion, and provide a new perspective on the problem of ranking from pairwise comparisons in non-active settings.
