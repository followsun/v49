	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<div id="abstract">
		<p>This work studies the maximum possible sign rank of <span class="math">\(N \times N\)</span> sign matrices with a given VC dimension <span class="math">\(d\)</span>. For <span class="math">\(d=1\)</span>, this maximum is <span>three</span>. For <span class="math">\(d=2\)</span>, this maximum is <span class="math">\(\tilde{\Theta}(N^{1/2})\)</span>. For <span class="math">\(d &gt;2\)</span>, similar but slightly less accurate statements hold. Our lower bounds improve over previous ones by Ben-David et al. and can be interpreted as exhibiting a weakness of kernel-based classifiers. Our upper bounds, on the other hand, can be interpreted as exhibiting the universality of kernel-based classifiers.</p>
<p>The lower bounds are obtained by probabilistic constructions, using a theorem of Warren in real algebraic topology. The upper bounds are obtained using a result of Welzl about spanning trees with low stabbing number, and using the moment curve.</p>
<p>The upper bound technique is also used to: (i) provide estimates on the number of classes of a given VC dimension, and the number of maximum classes of a given VC dimension – answering a question of Frankl from ’89, and (ii) design an efficient algorithm that provides an <span class="math">\(O(N/\log(N))\)</span> multiplicative approximation for the sign rank (computing the sign rank is equivalent to the existential theory of the reals).</p>
<p>We also observe a general connection between sign rank and spectral gaps which is based on Forster’s argument. Consider the <span class="math">\(N \times N\)</span> adjacency matrix of a <span class="math">\(\Delta\)</span> regular graph with a second eigenvalue of absolute value <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\Delta \leq N/2\)</span>. We show that the sign rank of the signed version of this matrix is at least <span class="math">\(\Delta/\lambda\)</span>. We use this connection to prove the existence of a maximum class <span class="math">\(C\subseteq\{\pm 1\}^N\)</span> with VC dimension <span class="math">\(2\)</span> and sign rank <span class="math">\(\tilde{\Theta}(N^{1/2})\)</span>. This answers a question of Ben-David et al. regarding the sign rank of large VC classes. We also describe limitations of this approach, in the spirit of the Alon-Boppana theorem.</p>
<p>We further describe connections to communication complexity, geometry, learning theory, and combinatorics.</p>
