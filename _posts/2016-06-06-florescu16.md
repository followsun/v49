title: Spectral thresholds in the bipartite stochastic block model
abstract: We consider a bipartite stochastic block model on vertex sets V_1 and V_2,
  with planted partitions in each, and ask at what densities efficient algorithms
  can recover the partition of the smaller vertex set. When |V_2| â‰«|V_1|, multiple
  thresholds emerge.  We first locate a sharp threshold for detection of the partition,
  in the sense of the results of Mossel, Neeman and Sly and  Massoulie for the stochastic
  block model.  We then show that at a higher edge density, the singular vectors of
  the rectangular biadjacency matrix exhibit a localization / delocalization phase
  transition, giving recovery above the threshold and no recovery below.  Nevertheless,
  we propose a simple spectral algorithm,  Diagonal Deletion SVD, which recovers the
  partition at a nearly optimal edge density. The bipartite stochastic block model
  studied here was used by Feldman, Perkins, Vempala to give a unified algorithm for
  recovering planted partitions and assignments in random hypergraphs and random k-SAT
  formulae respectively.  Our results give the best known bounds for the clause density
  at which solutions can be found efficiently in these models as well as showing a
  barrier to further improvement via this reduction to the bipartite block model.
