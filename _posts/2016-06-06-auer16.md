title: An algorithm with nearly optimal pseudo-regret for both stochastic and adversarial
  bandits
abstract: 'We present an algorithm that achieves almost optimal pseudo-regret bounds
  against adversarial and stochastic bandits. Against adversarial bandits the pseudo-regret
  is O(K\sqrtn \log n) and against stochastic bandits the pseudo-regret is O(\sum_i
  (\log n)/\Delta_i). We also show that no algorithm with O(\log n) pseudo-regret
  against stochastic bandits can achieve \tildeO(\sqrtn) expected regret against adaptive
  adversarial bandits. This complements previous results of Bubeck and Slivkins (2012)
  that show \tildeO(\sqrtn) expected adversarial regret with O((\log n)^2) stochastic
  pseudo-regret. '
