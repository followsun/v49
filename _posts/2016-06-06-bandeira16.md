title: On the low-rank approach for semidefinite programs arising in synchronization
  and community detection
abstract: To address difficult optimization problems, convex relaxations based on
  semidefinite programming are now common place in many fields. Although solvable
  in polynomial time, large semidefinite programs tend to be computationally challenging.
  Over a decade ago, exploiting the fact that in many applications of interest the
  desired solutions are low rank, Burer and Monteiro proposed a heuristic to solve
  such semidefinite programs by restricting the search space to low-rank matrices.
  The accompanying theory does not explain the extent of the empirical success. We
  focus on Synchronization and Community Detection problems and provide theoretical
  guarantees shedding light on the remarkable efficiency of this heuristic.
