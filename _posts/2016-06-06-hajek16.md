title: Semidefinite Programs for Exact Recovery of a Hidden Community
abstract: 'We study a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of the maximum likelihood
  estimation for exactly recovering a hidden community of cardinality K from an n
  \times n symmetric data matrix A, where for distinct indices i,j, A_ij ∼P if i,
  j are both in the community and A_ij ∼Q otherwise, for two known probability distributions
  P and Q. We identify a  sufficient condition  and a  necessary condition for the
  success of SDP  for the general model. For both the Bernoulli case (P=\rm Bern(p)
  and Q=\rm Bern(q) with p>q) and the Gaussian case (P=\mathcalN(μ,1) and Q=\mathcalN(0,1)
  with μ>0), which correspond to the problem of planted dense subgraph recovery and
  submatrix localization respectively, the general results lead to the following findings:
  (1) If K=ω( n /\log n), SDP attains the information-theoretic recovery limits with
  sharp constants; (2) If K=Θ(n/\log n), SDP is order-wise optimal, but strictly suboptimal
  by a constant factor; (3) If K=o(n/\log n) and K \to ∞, SDP is order-wise suboptimal.
  The same critical scaling for K is found to hold, up to constant factors, for the
  performance of SDP on the stochastic block model of n vertices partitioned into
  multiple communities of equal size K. A key ingredient in the proof of the necessary
  condition is a construction of a primal feasible solution based on random perturbation
  of the true cluster matrix. '
