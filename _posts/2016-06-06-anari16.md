title: Monte Carlo Markov Chain Algorithms for Sampling Strongly Rayleigh Distributions
  and Determinantal Point Processes
abstract: 'Strongly Rayleigh distributions are natural generalizations of product
  and determinantal probability distributions and satisfy the strongest form of negative
  dependence properties. We show that the "natural" Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC)
  algorithm mixes rapidly in the support of a homogeneous strongly Rayleigh distribution.
  As a byproduct, our proof implies Markov chains can be used to efficiently generate
  approximate samples of a k-determinantal point process. This answers an open question
  raised by Deshpande and Rademacher which was studied recently by Kang, Li-Jegelka-Sra,
  and Rebeschini-Karbasi. '
