title: 'Streaming PCA: Matching Matrix Bernstein and Near-Optimal Finite Sample Guarantees
  for Oja’s Algorithm'
abstract: In this paper we provide improved guarantees for streaming principal component
  analysis (PCA). Given A_1, \ldots, A_n∈\mathbbR^d\times d sampled independently
  from distributions satisfying \mathbbE[A_i] = Σfor Σ\succeq 0, we present an O(d)-space
  linear-time single-pass streaming algorithm for estimating the top eigenvector of
  Σ. The algorithm nearly matches (and in certain cases improves upon) the accuracy
  obtained by the standard batch method that computes top eigenvector of the empirical
  covariance \frac1n \sum_i ∈[n] A_i as analyzed by the matrix Bernstein inequality.
  Moreover, to achieve constant accuracy, our algorithm improves upon the best previous
  known sample complexities of streaming algorithms by either a multiplicative factor
  of O(d) or 1/\mathrmgap where \mathrmgap is the relative distance between the top
  two eigenvalues of Σ. We achieve these results through a novel analysis of the classic
  Oja’s algorithm, one of the oldest and perhaps, most popular algorithms for streaming
  PCA. We show that simply picking a random initial point w_0 and applying the natural
  update rule w_i + 1 = w_i + \eta_i A_i w_i suffices for suitable choice of \eta_i.
  We believe our result sheds light on how to efficiently perform streaming PCA both
  in theory and in practice and we hope that our analysis may serve as the basis for
  analyzing many variants and extensions of streaming PCA.
