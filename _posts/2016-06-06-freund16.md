title: 'Open Problem: Second order regret bounds based on scaling time'
abstract: We argue that the second order bounds given in Cesa-Bianchi2006, which accumulate
  the square of the loss of each action separately, are loose. We propose a different
  form of a second order bound and conjecture the it is satisfied by NormalHedge ChaudhuriFrHs2009.
