title: Aggregation of supports along the Lasso path
abstract: 'In linear regression with fixed design, we propose two procedures that
  aggregate a data-driven collection of supports. The collection is a subset of the
  2^p possible supports and both its cardinality and its elements can depend on the
  data. The procedures satisfy oracle inequalities with no assumption on the design
  matrix. Then we use these procedures to aggregate the supports that appear on the
  regularization path of the Lasso in order to construct an estimator that mimics
  the best Lasso estimator. If the restricted eigenvalue condition on the design matrix
  is satisfied, then this estimator achieves optimal prediction bounds. Finally, we
  discuss the computational cost of these procedures. '
