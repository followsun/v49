title: When can we rank well from comparisons of O(n\log(n)) non-actively chosen pairs?
abstract: Ranking from pairwise comparisons is a ubiquitous problem and has been studied
  in disciplines ranging from statistics to operations research and from theoretical
  computer science to machine learning. Here we consider a general setting where outcomes
  of pairwise comparisons between items i and j are drawn probabilistically by flipping
  a coin with unknown bias P_ij , and ask under what conditions on these unknown probabilities
  one can learn a good ranking from comparisons of only O(n\log(n)) non-actively chosen
  pairs. Recent work has established this is possible under the Bradley-Terry-Luce
  (BTL) and noisy permutation (NP) models. Here we introduce a broad family of ‘low-rank’
  conditions on the probabilities P_ij under which the resulting preference matrix
  P has low rank under some link function, and show these conditions encompass the
  BTL and Thurstone classes as special cases, but are considerably more general. We
  then give a new algorithm called low-rank pairwise ranking (LRPR) which provably
  learns a good ranking from comparisons of only O(n\log(n)) randomly chosen comparisons
  under such low-rank models. Our algorithm and analysis make use of tools from the
  theory of low-rank matrix completion, and provide a new perspective on the problem
  of ranking from pairwise comparisons in non-active settings.
