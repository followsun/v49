title: Pure Exploration of Multi-armed Bandit Under Matroid Constraints
abstract: "We study the pure exploration problem subject to a matroid constraint\t(Best-Basis)
  in a stochastic multi-armed bandit game. In a Best-Basis instance, we are given
  n stochastic arms with unknown reward distributions, as well as a matroid \\mathcalM
  over the arms. Let the weight of an arm be the mean of its reward distribution.
  Our goal is to identify a basis of \\mathcalM with the maximum total weight, using
  as few samples as possible. The problem is a significant generalization of the best
  arm identification problem and the top-k arm identification problem, which have
  attracted significant attentions in recent years. We study both the exact and PAC
  versions of Best-Basis, and provide algorithms with nearly-optimal sample complexities
  for these versions. Our results generalize and/or improve on several previous results
  for the top-k arm identification problem and the combinatorial pure exploration
  problem when the combinatorial constraint is a matroid."
