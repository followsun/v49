title: Cortical Computation via Iterative Constructions
abstract: We study Boolean functions of an arbitrary number of input variables that
  can be realized by simple iterative constructions based on constant-size primitives.
  This restricted type of construction needs little global coordination or control
  and thus is a candidate for neurally feasible computation. Valiantâ€™s construction
  of a majority function can be realized in this manner and, as we show, can be generalized
  to any uniform threshold function. We study the rate of convergence, finding that
  while linear convergence to the correct function can be achieved for any threshold
  using a fixed set of primitives, for quadratic convergence, the size of the primitives
  must grow as the threshold approaches 0 or 1. We also study finite realizations
  of this process and the learnability of the functions realized. We show that the
  constructions realized are accurate outside a small interval near the target threshold,
  where the size of the construction grows as the inverse square of the interval width.
  This phenomenon, that errors are higher closer to thresholds (and thresholds closer
  to the boundary are harder to represent), is a well-known cognitive finding.
