title: A Guide to Learning Arithmetic Circuits
abstract: 'An \empharithmetic circuit is a directed acyclic graph in which the operations
  are {+,\times}. In this paper, we exhibit several connections between learning algorithms
  for arithmetic circuits and other problems. In particular, we show that: \beginitemize
  \item Efficient learning algorithms for arithmetic circuit classes imply explicit
  exponential lower bounds. \item General circuits and formulas can be learned efficiently
  with membership and equivalence queries iff they can be learned efficiently with
  membership queries only. \item Low-query learning algorithms for certain classes
  of circuits imply explicit rigid matrices. \item Learning algorithms for multilinear
  depth-3 and depth-4 circuits must compute square roots. \enditemize'
