title: 'Open Problem: Best Arm Identification: Almost Instance-Wise Optimality and
  the Gap Entropy Conjecture'
abstract: 'The best arm identification problem (BEST-1-ARM) is the most basic pure
  exploration problem in stochastic multi-armed bandits. The problem has a long history
  and attracted significant attention for the last decade. However, we do not yet
  have a complete understanding of the optimal sample complexity of the problem: The
  state-of-the-art algorithms achieve a sample complexity of O(\sum_i=2^n \Delta_i^-2(\lnδ^-1
  + \ln\ln\Delta_i^-1)) (\Delta_i is the difference between the largest mean and the
  i^th mean), while the best known lower bound is Ω(\sum_i=2^n \Delta_i^-2\lnδ^-1)
  for general instances and Ω(∆^-2 \ln\ln ∆^-1) for the two-arm instances. We propose
  to study the instance-wise optimality for the BEST-1-ARM problem. Previous work
  has proved that it is impossible to have an instance optimal algorithm for the 2-arm
  problem. However, we conjecture that modulo the additive term Ω(\Delta_2^-2 \ln\ln
  \Delta_2^-1) (which is an upper bound and worst case lower bound for the 2-arm problem),
  there is an instance optimal algorithm for BEST-1-ARM. Moreover, we introduce a
  new quantity, called the gap entropy for a best-arm problem instance, and conjecture
  that it is the instance-wise lower bound. Hence, resolving this conjecture would
  provide a final answer to the old and basic problem.'
