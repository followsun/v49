title: 'Open Problem: Property Elicitation and Elicitation Complexity'
abstract: 'The study of property elicitation is gaining ground in statistics and machine
  learning as a way to view and reason about the expressive power of emiprical risk
  minimization (ERM).  Yet beyond a widening frontier of special cases, the two most
  fundamental questions in this area remain open: which statistics are elicitable
  (computable via ERM), and which loss functions elicit them?  Moreover, recent work
  suggests a complementary line of questioning: given a statistic, how many ERM parameters
  are needed to compute it?  We give concrete instantiations of these important questions,
  which have numerous applications to machine learning and related fields.'
