title: Learning Simple Auctions
abstract: 'We present a general framework for proving polynomial sample complexity
  bounds for the problem of learning from samples the best auction in a class of “simple”
  auctions.  Our framework captures the most prominent examples of “simple” auctions,
  including anonymous and non-anonymous item and bundle pricings, with either a single
  or multiple buyers.  The first step of the framework is to show that the set of
  auction allocation rules have a low-dimensional representation.  The second step
  shows that, across the subset of auctions that share the same allocations on a given
  set of samples, the auction revenue varies in a low-dimensional way. Our results
  effectively imply that whenever it is possible to compute a near-optimal simple
  auction with a known prior, it is also possible to compute such an auction with
  an unknown prior, given a polynomial number of samples. '
