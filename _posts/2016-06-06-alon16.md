title: Sign rank versus VC dimension
abstract: 'This work studies the maximum possible sign rank of N \times N sign matrices
  with a given VC dimension d. For d=1, this maximum is three. For d=2, this maximum
  is \tildeΘ(N^1/2). For d >2, similar but slightly less accurate statements hold.
  Our lower bounds improve over previous ones by Ben-David et al. and can be interpreted
  as exhibiting a weakness of kernel-based classifiers. Our upper bounds, on the other
  hand, can be interpreted as exhibiting the universality of kernel-based classifiers.
  The lower bounds are obtained by probabilistic constructions, using a theorem of
  Warren in real algebraic topology. The upper bounds are obtained using a result
  of Welzl about spanning trees with low stabbing number, and using the moment curve.
  The upper bound technique is also used to: (i) provide estimates on the number of
  classes of a given VC dimension, and the number of maximum classes of a given VC
  dimension – answering a question of Frankl from ’89, and (ii) design an efficient
  algorithm that provides an O(N/\log(N)) multiplicative approximation for the sign
  rank (computing the sign rank is equivalent to the existential theory of the reals).
  We also observe a general connection between sign rank and spectral gaps which is
  based on Forster’s argument. Consider the N \times N adjacency matrix of a ∆regular
  graph with a second eigenvalue of absolute value λand ∆≤N/2. We show that the sign
  rank of the signed version of this matrix is at least ∆/λ. We use this connection
  to prove the existence of a maximum class C⊆{\pm 1}^N with VC dimension 2 and sign
  rank \tildeΘ(N^1/2). This answers a question of Ben-David et al. regarding the sign
  rank of large VC classes. We also describe limitations of this approach, in the
  spirit of the Alon-Boppana theorem. We further describe connections to communication
  complexity, geometry, learning theory, and combinatorics.'
