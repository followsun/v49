title: Learning Combinatorial Functions from Pairwise Comparisons
abstract: A large body of work in machine learning has focused on the problem of learning
  a close approximation to an underlying combinatorial function, given a small set
  of labeled examples. However, for real-valued functions, cardinal labels might not
  be accessible, or it may be difficult for an expert to consistently assign real-valued
  labels over the entire set of examples. For instance, it is notoriously hard for
  consumers to reliably assign values to bundles of merchandise. Instead, it might
  be much easier for a consumer to report which of two bundles she likes better. With
  this motivation in mind, we consider an alternative learning model, wherein the
  algorithm must learn the underlying function up to pairwise comparisons, from pairwise
  comparisons. In this model, we present a series of novel algorithms that learn over
  a wide variety of combinatorial function classes. These range from graph functions
  to broad classes of valuation functions that are fundamentally important in microeconomic
  theory, the analysis of social networks, and machine learning, such as coverage,
  submodular, XOS, and subadditive functions, as well as functions with sparse Fourier
  support.
