title: Online Learning with Low Rank Experts
abstract: 'We consider the problem of prediction with expert advice when the losses
  of the experts have low-dimensional structure: they are restricted to an unknown
  d-dimensional subspace. We devise algorithms with regret bounds that are independent
  of the number of experts and depend only on the rank d. For the stochastic model
  we show a tight bound of Θ(\sqrtdT), and extend it to a setting of an approximate
  d subspace. For the adversarial model we show an upper bound of O(d\sqrtT) and a
  lower bound of Ω(\sqrtdT). '
