title: An Improved Gap-Dependency Analysis of the Noisy Power Method
abstract: We consider the \emphnoisy power method algorithm, which has wide applications
  in machine learning and statistics, especially those related to principal component
  analysis (PCA) under resource (communication, memory or privacy) constraints. Existing
  analysis of the noisy power method shows an unsatisfactory dependency over the “consecutive"
  spectral gap (\sigma_k-\sigma_k+1) of an input data matrix, which could be very
  small and hence limits the algorithm’s applicability. In this paper, we present
  a new analysis of the noisy power method that achieves improved gap dependency for
  both sample complexity and noise tolerance bounds. More specifically, we improve
  the dependency over (\sigma_k-\sigma_k+1) to dependency over (\sigma_k-\sigma_q+1),
  where q is an intermediate algorithm parameter and could be much larger than the
  target rank k. Our proofs are built upon a novel characterization of proximity between
  two subspaces that differ from canonical angle characterizations analyzed in previous
  works. Finally, we apply our improved bounds to distributed private PCA and memory-efficient
  streaming PCA and obtain bounds that are superior to existing results in the literature.
