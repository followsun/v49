title: Optimal Best Arm Identification with Fixed Confidence
abstract: We give a complete characterization of the complexity of best-arm identification
  in one-parameter bandit problems. We prove a new, tight lower bound on the sample
  complexity. We propose the ‘Track-and-Stop’ strategy, which we prove to be asymptotically
  optimal. It consists in a new sampling rule (which tracks the optimal proportions
  of arm draws highlighted by the lower bound) and in a stopping rule named after
  Chernoff, for which we give a new analysis.
