title: Online Learning and Blackwell Approachability in Quitting Games
abstract: 'We consider  the sequential decision problem known as regret minimization,
  or more precisely its generalization to the  vectorial or multi-criteria  setup
  called Blackwell approachability. We  assume that   Nature, the decision maker,
  or both, might have some quitting (or terminating) actions so that the stream of
  payoffs is constant whenever they are chosen. We call those environments  “quitting
  games”. We characterize convex target sets \cC that are Blackwell approachable,
  in the sense that the decision maker has a policy ensuring that the expected average
  vector payoff converges to \cC at some given horizon known in advance. Moreover,
  we also compare these results to the cases where  the horizon is not known and show
  that, unlike in standard online learning literature, the necessary or sufficient
  conditions for the anytime version of this problem are drastically different than
  those for the fixed horizon. '
