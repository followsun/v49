title: Asymptotic behavior of \ell_p-based Laplacian regularization in semi-supervised
  learning
abstract: 'Given a weighted graph with N vertices, consider a real-valued regression
  problem in a semi-supervised setting, where one observes n labeled vertices, and
  the task is to label the remaining ones. We present a theoretical study of \ell_p-based
  Laplacian regularization under a d-dimensional geometric random graph model. We
  provide a variational characterization of the performance of this regularized learner
  as N grows to infinity while n stays constant; the associated optimality conditions
  lead to a partial differential equation that must be satisfied by the associated
  function estimate \widehatf.  From this formulation we derive several predictions
  on the limiting behavior the function \fhat, including (a) a phase transition in
  its smoothness at the threshold p = d + 1; and (b) a tradeoff between smoothness
  and sensitivity to the underlying unlabeled data distribution P.  Thus, over the
  range p ≤d, the function estimate \widehatf is degenerate and “spiky,” whereas for
  p≥d+1, the function estimate \fhat is smooth.  We show that the effect of the underlying
  density vanishes monotonically with p, such that in the limit p = ∞, corresponding
  to the so-called Absolutely Minimal Lipschitz Extension, the estimate \widehatf
  is independent of the distribution P. Under the assumption of semi-supervised smoothness,
  ignoring P can lead to poor statistical performance; in particular, we construct
  a specific example for d=1 to demonstrate that p=2 has lower risk than p=∞due to
  the former penalty adapting to P and the latter ignoring it.  We also provide simulations
  that verify the accuracy of our predictions for finite sample sizes.  Together,
  these properties show that p = d+1 is an optimal choice, yielding a function estimate
  \fhat that is both smooth and non-degenerate, while remaining maximally sensitive
  to P. '
