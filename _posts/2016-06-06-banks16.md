title: Information-theoretic thresholds for community detection in sparse networks
abstract: We give upper and lower bounds on the information-theoretic threshold for
  community detection in the stochastic block model.  Specifically, consider a symmetric
  stochastic block model with q groups, average degree d, and connection probabilities
  c_\mathrmin/n and c_\mathrmout/n for within-group and between-group edges respectively;
  let λ= (c_\mathrmin-c_\mathrmout)/(qd).  We show that, when q is large, and λ= O(1/q),
  the critical value of d at which community detection becomes possible—in physical
  terms, the condensation threshold—is $ d_\mathrmc = Θ\left( \frac\log qq λ^2 \right)
   ,  with tighter results in certain regimes.  Above this threshold, we show that
  any partition of the nodes into q groups which is as ‘good’ as the planted one,
  in terms of the number of within- and between-group edges, is correlated with it.
  This gives an exponential-time algorithm that performs better than chance; specifically,
  community detection becomes possible below the Kesten-Stigum bound for q \ge 5 in
  the disassortative case λ< 0, and for q \ge 11 in the assortative case λ> 0 (similar
  upper bounds were obtained independently by Abbe and Sandon). Conversely, below
  this threshold, we show that no algorithm can label the vertices better than chance,
  or even distinguish the block model from an Erdős-Rényi random graph with high probability.
  Our lower bound on d_\mathrmc uses Robinson and Wormald’s small subgraph conditioning
  method, and we also give (less explicit) results for non-symmetric stochastic block
  models.  In the symmetric case, we obtain explicit results by using bounds on certain
  functions of doubly stochastic matrices due to Achlioptas and Naor; indeed, our
  lower bound on d_\mathrmc is their second moment lower bound on the q$-colorability
  threshold for random graphs with a certain effective degree.
