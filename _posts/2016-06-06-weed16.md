abstract: 'Motivated by online advertising auctions, we consider repeated Vickrey
  auctions where goods of unknown value are sold sequentially and bidders only learn
  (potentially noisy) information about a goodâ€™s value once it is purchased. We adopt
  an online learning approach with bandit feedback to  model this problem and derive
  bidding strategies for two models: stochastic and adversarial. In the stochastic
  model, the observed values of the goods are  random variables centered around the
  true value of the good. In this case, logarithmic regret is achievable when competing
  against well behaved adversaries. In the adversarial model, the goods need not be
  identical. Comparing our performance against that of the best fixed bid in hindsight,
  we show that sublinear regret is also achievable in this case. For both the stochastic
  and adversarial models, we prove matching minimax lower bounds showing our strategies
  to be optimal up to lower-order terms. To our knowledge, this is the first complete
  set of strategies for bidders participating in auctions of this type.'
