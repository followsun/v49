title: Simple Bayesian Algorithms for Best Arm Identification
abstract: This paper considers the optimal adaptive allocation of measurement effort
  for identifying the best among a finite set of options or designs.  An experimenter
  sequentially chooses designs to measure and observes noisy signals of their quality
  with the goal of confidently identifying the best design  after a small number of
  measurements. I propose three simple Bayesian algorithms for adaptively allocating
  measurement effort. One is Top-Two Probability sampling, which computes the two
  designs with the highest posterior probability of being optimal, and then randomizes
  to select among these two. One is a variant a top-two sampling which considers not
  only the probability a design is optimal, but the expected amount by which its quality
  exceeds that of other designs. The final algorithm is a modified version of Thompson
  sampling that is tailored for identifying the best design. I prove that these simple
  algorithms satisfy a strong optimality property. In a frequestist setting where
  the true quality of the designs is fixed, one hopes the posterior definitively identifies
  the optimal design, in the sense that that the posterior probability assigned to
  the event that some other design is optimal converges to zero as measurements are
  collected. I show that under the proposed algorithms this convergence occurs at
  an \emphexponential rate, and the corresponding exponent is the best possible among
  all allocation rules.
