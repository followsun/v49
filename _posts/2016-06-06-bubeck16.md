title: Multi-scale exploration of convex functions and bandit convex optimization
abstract: We construct a new map from a convex function to a distribution on its domain,
  with the property that this distribution is a multi-scale exploration of the function.
  We use this map to solve a decade-old open problem in adversarial bandit convex
  optimization by showing that the minimax regret for this problem is \tildeO(\mathrmpoly(n)
  \sqrtT), where n is the dimension and T the number of rounds. This bound is obtained
  by studying the dual Bayesian maximin regret via the information ratio analysis
  of Russo and Van Roy, and then using the multi-scale exploration to construct a
  new algorithm for the Bayesian convex bandit problem.
