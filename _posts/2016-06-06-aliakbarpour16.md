title: Learning and Testing Junta Distributions
abstract: 'We consider the problem of learning distributions in the presence of irrelevant
  features. This problem is formalized by introducing a new notion of \emphk-junta
  distributions. Informally, a distribution \mathcalD over the domain \mathcalX^n
  is a \emphk-junta distribution with respect to another distribution \mathcalU over
  the same domain if there is a set J ⊆[n] of size |J| \le k that captures the difference
  between \mathcal D and \mathcalU. We show that it is possible to learn k-junta distributions
  with respect to the uniform distribution over the Boolean hypercube {0,1}^n in time
  \poly(n^k, 1/ε). This result is obtained via a new Fourier-based learning algorithm
  inspired by the Low-Degree Algorithm of Linial, Mansour, and Nisan (1993). We also
  consider the problem of testing whether an unknown distribution is a k-junta distribution
  with respect to the uniform distribution. We give a nearly-optimal algorithm for
  this task. Both the analysis of the algorithm and the lower bound showing its optimality
  are obtained by establishing connections between the problem of testing junta distributions
  and testing uniformity of weighted collections of distributions. '
