title: On the capacity of information processing systems
abstract: 'We propose and analyze a family of \emphinformation processing systems,
  where a finite set of experts or servers are employed to extract information about
  a stream of incoming jobs. Each job is associated with a hidden label drawn from
  some prior distribution. An inspection by an expert produces a noisy outcome that
  depends both on the job’s hidden label and the type of the expert, and occupies
  the expert for a finite time duration. A decision maker’s task is to dynamically
  assign inspections so that the resulting outcomes can be used to accurately recover
  the labels of all jobs, while keeping the system stable. Among our chief motivations
  are applications in crowd-sourcing, diagnostics, and experiment designs, where one
  wishes to efficiently discover the nature of a large number of items, using a finite
  pool of computational resources or human agents. We focus on the \emphcapacity of
  such an information processing system. Given a level of accuracy guarantee, we ask
  how many experts are needed in order to stabilize the system, and through what inspection
  architecture. Our main result provides an adaptive inspection policy that is asymptotically
  optimal in the following sense: the ratio between the required number of experts
  under our policy and the theoretical optimal converges to one, as the probability
  of error in label recovery tends to zero.'
