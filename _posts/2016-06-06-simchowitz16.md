title: Best-of-K-bandits
abstract: 'This paper studies the Best-of-K Bandit game: At each time the player chooses
  a subset S among all N-choose-K possible options and observes reward max(X(i) :
  i in S) where X is a random vector drawn from a joint distribution. The objective
  is to identify the subset that achieves the highest expected reward with high probability
  using as few queries as possible. We present distribution-dependent lower bounds
  based on a particular construction which force a learner to consider all N-choose-K
  subsets, and match naive extensions of known upper bounds in the bandit setting
  obtained by treating each subset as a separate arm. Nevertheless, we present evidence
  that exhaustive search may be avoided for certain, favorable distributions because
  the influence of high-order order correlations may be dominated by lower order statistics.
  Finally, we present an algorithm and analysis for independent arms, which mitigates
  the surprising non-trivial information occlusion that occurs due to only observing
  the max in the subset. This may inform strategies for more general dependent measures,
  and we complement these result with independent-arm lower bounds. '
