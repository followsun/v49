title: 'How to calculate partition functions using convex programming hierarchies:
  provable bounds for variational methods'
abstract: 'We consider the problem of approximating partition functions for Ising
  models. We make use of recent tools in combinatorial optimization: the Sherali-Adams
  and Lasserre convex programming hierarchies, in combination with variational methods
  to get algorithms for calculating partition functions in these families. These techniques
  give new, non-trivial approximation guarantees for the partition function beyond
  the regime of correlation decay. They also generalize some classical results from
  statistical physics about the Curie-Weiss ferromagnetic Ising model, as well as
  provide a partition function counterpart of classical results about max-cut on dense
  graphs (Arora, 1995). With this, we connect techniques from two apparently disparate
  research areas – optimization and counting/partition function approximations. (i.e.
  #-P type of problems). Furthermore, we design to the best of our knowledge the first
  provable, convex variational methods. Though in the literature there are a host
  of convex versions of variational methods, they come with no guarantees (apart from
  some extremely special cases, like e.g. the graph has a single cycle). We consider
  dense and low rank graphs, and interestingly, the reason our approach works on these
  types of graphs is because local correlations propagate to global correlations –
  completely the opposite of algorithms based on correlation decay. In the process
  we design novel entropy approximations based on the low-order moments of a distribution.
  Our proof techniques are very simple and generic, and likely to be applicable to
  many other settings other than Ising models. '
