title: Optimal rates for total variation denoising
abstract: 'Motivated by its practical success, we show that the 2D total variation
  denoiser satisfies a sharp oracle inequality that leads to near optimal rates of
  estimation for a large class of image models such as bi-isotonic, Hölder smooth
  and cartoons. Our analysis hinges on properties of the unnormalized Laplacian of
  the  two-dimensional grid such as eigenvector delocalization and spectral decay.
  We also present extensions to more than two dimensions as well as several other
  graphs. '
