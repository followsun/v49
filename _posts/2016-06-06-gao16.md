title: Preference-based Teaching
abstract: 'We introduce a new model of teaching named “preference-based teaching”
  and a corresponding complexity parameter—the preference-based teaching dimension
  (PBTD)—representing the worst-case number of examples needed to teach any concept
  in a given concept class. Although the PBTD coincides with the well-known recursive
  teaching dimension (RTD) on finite classes, it is radically different on infinite
  ones: the RTD becomes infinite already for trivial infinite classes (such as half-intervals)
  whereas the PBTD evaluates to reasonably small values for a wide collection of infinite
  classes including classes consisting of so-called closed sets w.r.t. a given closure
  operator, including various classes related to linear sets over \mathbbN_0 (whose
  RTD had been studied quite recently) and including the class of Euclidean half-spaces
  (and some other geometric classes). On top of presenting these concrete results,
  we provide the reader with a theoretical framework (of a combinatorial flavor) which
  helps to derive bounds on the PBTD.'
