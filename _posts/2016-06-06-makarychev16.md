title: Learning Communities in the Presence of Errors
abstract: 'We study the problem of learning communities in the presence of modeling
  errors and give  robust recovery algorithms for the Stochastic Block Model (SBM).
  This model, which is also known as the Planted Partition Model,  is widely used
  for community detection and graph partitioning in various fields, including machine
  learning,  statistics, and social sciences. Many algorithms exist for learning communities
  in the Stochastic Block Model, but they do not work well in the presence of errors.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of robust algorithms for partial recovery in
  SBM with modeling errors or noise. We consider graphs generated according to the
  Stochastic Block Model and then modified by an adversary. We allow two types of
  adversarial errors, Feige—Kilian or monotone errors, and edge outlier errors. Mossel,
  Neeman and Sly (STOC 2015) posed an open question about whether an almost exact
  recovery is possible when the adversary is allowed to add o(n) edges. Our work answers
  this question affirmatively even in the case of k>2 communities. We then show that
  our algorithms work not only when the instances come from SBM, but also work when
  the instances come from any distribution of graphs that is \varepsilon m close to
  SBM in the Kullback—Leibler divergence. This result also works in the presence of
  adversarial errors. Finally, we present almost tight lower bounds for two communities. '
