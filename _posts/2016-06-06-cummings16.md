title: Adaptive Learning with Robust Generalization Guarantees
abstract: The traditional notion of \emphgeneralization—i.e., learning a hypothesis
  whose empirical error is close to its true error—is surprisingly brittle. As has
  recently been noted [Dwork et al. 2015], even if several algorithms have this guarantee
  in isolation, the guarantee need not hold if the algorithms are composed adaptively.
  In this paper, we study three notions of generalization—increasing in strength—that
  are \emphrobust to postprocessing and amenable to adaptive composition, and examine
  the relationships between them.  We call the weakest such notion \emphRobust Generalization.
  A second, intermediate, notion is the stability guarantee known as \emphdifferential
  privacy. The strongest guarantee we consider we call \emphPerfect Generalization.
  We prove that every hypothesis class that is PAC learnable is also PAC learnable
  in a robustly generalizing fashion, with almost the same sample complexity. It was
  previously known that differentially private algorithms satisfy robust generalization.
  In this paper, we show that robust generalization is a strictly weaker concept,
  and that there is a learning task that can be carried out subject to robust generalization
  guarantees, yet cannot be carried out subject to differential privacy. We also show
  that perfect generalization is a strictly stronger guarantee than differential privacy,
  but that, nevertheless, many learning tasks can be carried out subject to the guarantees
  of perfect generalization.
