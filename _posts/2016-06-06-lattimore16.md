title: Regret Analysis of the Finite-Horizon Gittins Index Strategy for Multi-Armed
  Bandits
abstract: 'I prove near-optimal frequentist regret guarantees for the finite-horizon
  Gittins index strategy for multi-armed bandits with Gaussian noise and prior. Along
  the way I derive finite-time bounds on the Gittins index that are asymptotically
  exact and may be of independent interest. I also discuss computational issues and
  present experimental results suggesting that a particular version of the Gittins
  index strategy is an improvement on existing algorithms with finite-time regret
  guarantees such as UCB and Thompson sampling. '
