title: 'Interactive Algorithms: from Pool to Stream'
abstract: We consider interactive algorithms in the pool-based setting, and in the
  stream-based setting. Interactive algorithms observe suggested elements (representing
  actions or queries), and interactively select some of them and receive responses.
  Pool-based algorithms can select elements at any order, while stream-based algorithms
  observe elements in sequence, and can only select elements immediately after observing
  them. We assume that the suggested elements are generated independently from some
  source distribution, and ask what is the stream size required for emulating a pool
  algorithm with a given pool size. We provide algorithms and matching lower bounds
  for general pool algorithms, and for utility-based pool algorithms. We further show
  that a maximal gap between the two settings exists also in the special case of active
  learning for binary classification.
