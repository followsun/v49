title: On the Approximability of Sparse PCA
abstract: 'It is well known that Sparse PCA (Sparse Principal Component Analysis)
  is NP-hard to solve exactly on worst-case instances. What is the complexity of solving
  Sparse PCA approximately? Our contributions include: \beginenumerate \item a simple
  and efficient algorithm that achieves an n^-1/3-approximation; \item NP-hardness
  of approximation to within (1-\varepsilon), for some small constant \varepsilon
  > 0; \item SSE-hardness of approximation to within \em any constant factor; and
  \item an \exp\exp\left(Ω\left(\sqrt\log \log n\right)\right) (“quasi-quasi-polynomial”)
  gap for the standard semidefinite program. \endenumerate'
