	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<div id="abstract">
		<p>We give an algorithm for properly learning Poisson binomial distributions. A Poisson binomial distribution (PBD) of order <span class="math">\(n \in \mathbb{Z}_+\)</span> is the discrete probability distribution of the sum of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> mutually independent Bernoulli random variables. Given <span class="math">\(\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)\)</span> samples from an unknown PBD <span class="math">\(P\)</span>, our algorithm runs in time <span class="math">\((1/\eps)^{O(\log \log (1/\epsilon))}\)</span>, and outputs a hypothesis PBD that is <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>-close to <span class="math">\(P\)</span> in total variation distance. The sample complexity of our algorithm is known to be nearly-optimal, up to logarithmic factors, as established in previous work. However, the previously best known running time for properly learning PBDs was <span class="math">\((1/\epsilon)^{O(\log(1/\epsilon))}\)</span>, and was essentially obtained by enumeration over an appropriate <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>-cover. We remark that the running time of this cover-based approach cannot be improved, as any <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>-cover for the space of PBDs has size <span class="math">\((1/\epsilon)^{\Omega(\log(1/\epsilon))}\)</span>.</p>
<p>As one of our main contributions, we provide a novel structural characterization of PBDs, showing that any PBD <span class="math">\(P\)</span> is <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>-close to another PBD <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> with <span class="math">\(O(\log(1/\epsilon))\)</span> distinct parameters. More precisely, we prove that, for all <span class="math">\(\epsilon &gt;0,\)</span> there exists an explicit collection <span class="math">\(\cal{M}\)</span> of <span class="math">\((1/\epsilon)^{O(\log \log (1/\epsilon))}\)</span> vectors of multiplicities, such that for any PBD <span class="math">\(P\)</span> there exists a PBD <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> with <span class="math">\(O(\log(1/\epsilon))\)</span> distinct parameters whose multiplicities are given by some element of <span class="math">\({\cal M}\)</span>, such that <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> is <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>-close to <span class="math">\(P.\)</span> Our proof combines tools from Fourier analysis and algebraic geometry.</p>
<p>Our approach to the proper learning problem is as follows: Starting with an accurate non-proper hypothesis, we fit a PBD to this hypothesis. This fitting problem can be formulated as a natural polynomial optimization problem. Our aforementioned structural characterization allows us to reduce the corresponding fitting problem to a collection of <span class="math">\((1/\epsilon)^{O(\log \log(1/\epsilon))}\)</span> systems of low-degree polynomial inequalities. We show that each such system can be solved in time <span class="math">\((1/\epsilon)^{O(\log \log(1/\epsilon))}\)</span>, which yields the overall running time of our algorithm.</p>
